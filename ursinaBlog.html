    <h1>What is Ursina?</h1>
    <p>Ursina is a Library usable with Python. You can use the library to create 2D and 3D games. I chose Ursina
         For my 'Technical Blog' because of the simplicity. Creating characters, the playable environment, and functions 
         for your game are easy to learn and master. I started learning on it during the last semester switch.  
    </p>
    <h1>How to use Ursina?</h1>
    <p>Like all installs with python, open a terminal and input 'pip install ursina' </p>
    <div class="container">

        <img src="pipInstallUrsina.png" alt="pip">
    </div>

    <p>I already have Ursina installed, so instead of 'requirements already satisfied' you'll see downloads happening.</p>
    <p>INSTALL CONTENTS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>panda-3d, panda-3d-gltf & panda3d-simplepbr>=0.6</li>
        <li>pillow</li>
        <li>pyperclip</li>
        <li>screeninfo</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Important Imports</h1>
    <p>Just like importing random, time and sys with Python, Ursina needs to be imported.
    An absolute necessity is 'from ursina import *' which imports the whole Ursina library.
    If you like First Person games (like me) you can type 'from ursina.prefabs.first_person_controller import FirstPersonController'
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="fromUrsinaImport.png" alt="pip">
    </div>
    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>For my first game I chose a simple alien defense game. The player chills at the bottom while spaceships fall in from the sky.
        The goal is to hold of until the invaders decide to quit (Yes there is an end to the madness!) 
    </p>
    <h1>Gameplay Video</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <video controls autoplay loop muted width="800">
            <source src="final.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </div>
    <p>Below is the source code with comments, copy to your hearts content! Or at the bottom will be a link to this project on my Github. Just make sure you have Ursina installed for Python. Go up to 'How to use Ursina' for details.</p>

    <p>Lately I've been playing Chex Quest on my dos emulator and it's inspiring me to make an fps. Knowing fps controls I could take the shooting and enemy mechanics from this and put it in that. Or I could make a simple Pong clone haha. We shall see next time, thank you for coming through!</p>
